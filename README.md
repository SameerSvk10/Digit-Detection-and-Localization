This repository is a implementation of one of the task in e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2015-16

Description of the task can be found in the file 'Task1_Description.pdf'.
First run 'training.py' to create training samples and target data to train K-Nearest Neighbour model for digit recognition.
